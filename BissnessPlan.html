    <h1>The Project:</h1>
    <p>[Site Name] is a unique online bookstore that aims to bring rare and hard-to-find books to readers worldwide. The
        store focuses on public domain and out-of-print titles and is dedicated to preserving literary works that may
        otherwise be lost to time. Each book in [Site Name]'s catalog is carefully selected and presented in its
        original language or with interlinear translations for bilingual readers. With a simple and elegant design,
        [Site Name] offers an easy and enjoyable shopping experience for book lovers who appreciate quality and
        attention to detail. By utilizing the LULU book printing API, [Site Name] is able to offer a wide variety of
        titles in both physical and digital formats, making it easy for customers to access and enjoy their favorite
        books. The long-term goal of starting [Site Name]'s own publishing company reflects its passion for literature
        and commitment to preserving important works for future generations. </p>
    <h2>Public Domain Books:</h2>
    <p>Public domain books are no longer under copyright protection and can be freely used, copied, and distributed by
        anyone. This means that you can publish public domain books without having to obtain permission from any
        copyright owners or paying any royalties.
    </p>
    <p>However, it's important to note that not all versions of a book may be in the public domain. For example, a new
        translation or interpretation of a public domain work can still be protected by copyright if it is considered a
        new creative work. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the specific version of the book you want to publish
        is in fact in the public domain before doing so.</p>
    <p>Regarding the use of a manuscript scan as an interlinear translation, it would depend on whether the scan itself
        is in the public domain. If the manuscript is old enough to be in the public domain and the scan is simply a
        faithful reproduction of the original manuscript, then it would likely be considered in the public domain as
        well. However, if the scan is a modern reproduction or interpretation of the manuscript, it could be protected
        by copyright. In general, it's always a good idea to do your research and ensure that the materials you use are
        in the public domain or that you have obtained the necessary permissions to use them.</p>
    <h2>Here's a checklist of things you may want to consider as you develop your business plan:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Market research: Before you invest any money, you should conduct thorough market research to determine if
            there is a demand for your niche bookstore idea. This may involve analyzing your competition, identifying
            your target audience, and assessing the potential demand for your products.</li>
        <li>Business model: You'll need to decide on a business model that works for your bookstore, such as
            drop-shipping or holding inventory. Using the Lulu book printing API, you may want to consider printing
            books on-demand to minimize inventory costs. </li>
        <li>Website development: You'll need to create a website that is user-friendly and visually appealing to attract
            and retain customers. Consider using HUGO, a popular website builder, to create your site.
        </li>
        <li>Content creation: You'll need to curate and upload your book catalog to your website. Consider how you will
            organize
            your content, such as by genre or author, and ensure that each book has a detailed description.</li>
        <li>Payment and shipping: You'll need to set up a payment processing system on your website and establish a
            shipping
            process. Consider using the Lulu API to streamline this process.</li>

        <li>Marketing and promotion: You'll need to develop a marketing plan to promote your bookstore to your target
            audience.
            This
            may involve social media marketing, email marketing, and search engine optimization.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>In terms of goals, here are a few you may want to consider:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Launch a fully functional website with a catalog of at least 50 books within the first three months of
            operation.</li>
        <li>Generate $500 in revenue within the first month of operation.</li>
        <li>Increase website traffic by 25% within the first six months of operation.</li>
        <li>Expand your catalog to include at least 100 books within the first year of operation.</li>
        <li>Launch your own publishing company within two years of operation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Given your limited initial investment of R$: 100,00, you may need to bootstrap your business and focus on
        minimizing
        costs until you generate enough revenue to reinvest in the business. Good luck with your online bookstore!</p>
